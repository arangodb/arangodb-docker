# Building your own ArangoDB image

We are auto generating docker images via our build system so the Dockerfile is a template.
The post proccessed docker files end up in `stretch/[arangodbversion]/Dockerfile`. 

To build your own ArangoDB image pick the template file corrosponding to the arangodb major/minor version you 
want to build (i.e. 33 is intended to be used with ArangoDB 3.3.x):

```console
cp Dockerfile[version].templ Dockerfile
```

Adjust @VERSION@ in the Dockerfile to the version of arangodb you want to have and issue:

```console
docker build -t arangodb .
```

This will create an image named `arangodb`.
