# Building your own ArangoDB image

We are auto generating docker images via our [build system](https://github.com/arangodb/oskar/tree/master/containers) where you can find the Dockerfile templates.
The post proccessed docker files end up in `alpine/[arangodbversion]/Dockerfile`. 

To build your own ArangoDB image pick the template file from the corrosponding directory in the Oskar repo.
Use the arangodb major/minor version you want to build (i.e. 36 is intended to be used with ArangoDB 3.6.x):

```console
cp ../oskar/containers/arangodb[version]/* .
```

Adjust @VERSION@ in the Dockerfile to the version of arangodb you want to have and issue:

```console
docker build -t arangodb .
```

This will create an image named `arangodb`.
